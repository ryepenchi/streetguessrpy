# StreetGuessr
Guessing-Game for the streets of Vienna using **pygame**.
This was my first project after learning a bit of python
The original streetgraph and district shape data was downloaded from [data.wien.gv.at](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/1039ed7e-97fb-435f-b6cc-f6a105ba5e09) in JSON format and pickled manually.
The images are from [basemap.at] or created using the OpenData.
